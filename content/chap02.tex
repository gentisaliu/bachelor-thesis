\chapter{Experimental Background}
\label{ch:experiment}
This chapter presents the experimental context under which the single top quark shall be reconstructed. First, the accelerator complex of the Large Hadron Collider is introduced, then the layout of the Compact Muon Solenoid detector is described.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The Large Hadron Collider is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, part of the European Organization for Nuclear Research's (CERN) accelerator underground complex, located in the region of Geneva, in a tunnel at a depth ranging from 50 to \SI{175}{m}. It is a circular collider with a circumference of \SI{27}{km} that can accelerate protons, xenon ions and lead ions.

It consists of two adjacent parallel evacuated beam pipes, where protons circulate in opposite directions around the ring. The beams are not continuous, the protons are bunched together into up to 2808 bunches instead, each with $10^{11}$ protons, so that interactions can take place at discrete intervals. The beams intersect every \SI{25}{ns} at four points around the ring, where particle collisions occur. The beam is kept on its circular path by dipole magnets, while their focus is maintained by quadrupole magnets. The magnets are operated at a temperature of \SI{1.9}{K} by superfluid helium-4.

The particles' energy is increased successively by the linear particle accelerator LINAC 2 to \SI{50}{MeV}, the Proton Synchroton Booster (PSB) to \SI{1.4}{GeV}, the Proton Synchroton (PS) to \SI{26}{GeV}, and the Super Proton Synchroton (SPS) to \SI{450}{GeV}, where they are injected into the main ring. There, the protons are accelerated at the current energy record of \SI{6.5}{TeV} per proton and are finally circulated for up to 24 hours.

The LHC operation consists so far of two runs: in Run 1 beginning in 2010, the first collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{3.5}{TeV}$ started. The center-of-mass energy was upgraded in 2012 to $\sqrt{s}=\SI{8}{TeV}$. After a shutdown from 2013 to 2015, Run 2 began in 2015 at $\sqrt{s}=\SI{13}{TeV}$. The LHC will shut down by the end of 2018 to enter Run 3 at $\sqrt{s}=\SI{14}{TeV}$ in 2021.

Each of the four interaction point hosts one or multiple experiments. The most important ones are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ATLAS} - A Toroidal LHC Apparatus
\item \textbf{CMS} - Compact Muon Solenoid
\item \textbf{ALICE} - A Large Ion Collider Experiment
\item \textbf{LHCb} - Large Hadron Collider beauty
\end{itemize}
An overview of the LHC structure is given in Figure \ref{fig:lhc}.

The performance of a particle accelerator is quantified by the luminosity, which expresses the ratio between the event rate $\dv{N}{t}$ to the interaction cross-section $\sigma$ (the probability of a process to occur)
\begin{equation}
    L=\frac{1}{\sigma} \dv{N}{t}.
\end{equation}
The larger the luminosity, the more likely an event of interest is to happen within a period of time.

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment}

\end{figure}
The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a general-purpose particle detector built into the LHC, situated in an underground cavern at Cessy, France. Its design goal was to investigate a wide range of physics, such as TeV-scale physics, the properties of the Higgs boson, heavy ion collisions, physics beyond the SM (supersymmetry, extra dimensions). It has a length of \SI{28.7}{m}, a diameter of \SI{15}{m} and a weight of approximately \SI{14000}{t}. Figure \ref{fig:cms} shows a cross section view of the CMS detector.

The detector takes its name after its relatively small size, its muon tracking ability and powerful solenoid magnet.

The CMS detector is cylindrically symmetric towards the beam axis with the interaction point centrally located. The coordinate system is oriented such that the $z$ axis is in the direction of the beam, the polar angle $\theta$ is defined in the $r$-$z$ plane with the pseudorapidity defined as $\eta=-\ln{\tan{(\theta / 2)}}$. The momentum component transverse to the beam direction, $p_{\text{T}}$, is derived from the $x$- and $y$-components, the transverse energy is defined as $E_{\text{T}}=E \sin{\theta}$ \cite{Spannagel2017}.

The inside of the detector is permeated by a \SI{3.8}{T} magnetic field parallel to the beam axis, created by the solenoid magnet, which deflects all charged particles within the detector in a helical path.

The components of the CMS from the point of interaction to its extremities are as follows \cite{Bayatian:922757}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Silicon Tracker} is made of silicon pixels and microstrip detectors, which measure the paths of particles traveling outwards from the interaction point. As they pass through the tracker, charged particles create electron-hole pairs in the semiconducting material, which lead to tiny electric signals that are amplified and detected. The charge and momentum of the particle can be inferred from the curvature of the reconstructed path. The tracker is limited to detecting only particles with $|\eta|<2.5$. In order to avoid distortions in momentum measurements, the tracker was designed to reduce the interactions of particles with the tracker material.
    \item \textbf{The Electromagnetic Calorimeter} measures the energy of photons, electrons, and positrons by fully absorbing their energy. Lead tungstate crystals are used as absorber material, whose atoms can be excited by the absorption of secondary particles. The crystal leaves the excited state when photons are emitted. The intensity of the scintillation light is proportional to the energy of the absorbed particle and can be measured using photodetectors.
    \item \textbf{The Hadron Calorimeter} measures the energy of hadrons, i.e. protons, neutrons, pions, and kaons. It is made of alternating layers of absorber material and plastic scintillators. The incoming particles create a cascade of secondary particles within the absorber that cause the scintillators to emit light.
    \item \textbf{The muon system} reconstructs the paths of muons, similar to the silicon tracker. The muon detectors are located outside the solenoid. Due to their large mass compared to electrons, muons pass the inner components of the detector with negligible energy loss.
\end{itemize}

The CMS detector cannot detect neutrinos, since they barely interact with matter. This is done indirectly exploiting momentum conservation, where the sum of the transverse momenta of the collision products must vanish. The transverse momentum of the neutrinos thus equals the negative sum of the transverse momenta of the detected collision products. Assuming the neutrinos are massless, their transverse momenta equal their energy. This is also known as missing transverse energy (MET)
\begin{equation}
\slashed{E}_T=|-\sum{\va{p_\text{T}}}|.
\end{equation}

The LHC has a nominal bunch crossing frequency of about \SI{40}{MHz} with approximately 1 megabyte of data for every crossing at each interaction point. This leads to a data rate of 40 terabytes per second, which is very large given the available bandwidth out of the detector and disk space, moreover the data contains mostly physically uninteresting events. The trigger system of CMS detector reduces the event rate from \SI{40}{MHz} to \SI{1}{kHz} in two stages, making their transfer and storage feasible.

The first stage are the Level-1 (L1) triggers, which are realized by hardware electronics and filter out information from the calorimeters and the muon chambers, with only a few features of interest such as high energy jets, muons or missing energy being calculated. The triggers select events with hard scattering, and reduce the frequency by a factor of 400 to \SI{100}{kHz}. Afterwards, an online reconstruction with performance optimizations is run. This stage takes around \SI{1}{\micro s} to complete.

The second stage are the High Level Triggers (HLTs), which reduce the event rate by a further factor of 100 to \SI{1}{kHz}. The event data is then stored on tape for more detailed analysis. This trigger is software-based (mainly C++) and does complex calculations and a more precise reconstruction.
