My thanks go to everyone from the Institute of Experimental Particle Physics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, who contributed in creating a good working environment, in particular to:

Prof. Dr. Thomas Müller and Dr. Thorsten Chwalek for giving me the opportunity to prepare my bachelor thesis in their working group. Particle physics research has always fascinated me --- together with space exploration they represent humanity's most elaborate efforts to date in its attempt to give answers to basic questions and find order in the universe.

Darius Bühler for taking his time to answer my many particle physics-related questions, for proofreading my thesis, and for otherwise interesting discussions.

David Walter for introducing me to the topic of machine learning and for his useful insights.

My advisor, Dr. Nils Faltermann, for his support and for proofreading my thesis.

Also to my parents for their moral support.
